fbx2bvh
=======

Prerequisites
-------------

* Install VS2017 (or VS2019 with the 2017 build tools).

* Install the version of the FBX SDK correct for VS2017, from https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0

Building
--------

The easier approaches that don't require reconfiguring the project are the following:

1. Copy the include/ and lib/ directories of the FBX SDK installation to the same directory as this file.

2. Copy the fbx2bvh/ directory into the directory of the FBX SDK installation. If that's in Program Files, the writing restrictions might need to be tackled.

Open the project and build.
